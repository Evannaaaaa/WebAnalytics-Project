Web Crawling and Airline Ticket Fare Analysis in Expedia 

•	Employed Selenium WebDriver to scrape Expedia, generating a dataset of 793 records across 6 attributes to study airline ticket pricing dynamics.  
•	Applied LASSO Regression to the dataset, identifying the number of stops as the most significant predictor negatively correlated with flight fares.  
•	Conducted sentiment analysis using the Tweepy API to collect Twitter data on customer experiences with different airlines. Utilized Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from the nltk.sentiment package to analyze the sentiment scores.  
•	Revealed that Sun Country Airline typically offers more expensive tickets, while United Airlines garnered the highest sentiment scores from customers.  
•	Advised against ticket purchasing during the 7-8 PM window due to observed higher prices, based on crawl time data.
